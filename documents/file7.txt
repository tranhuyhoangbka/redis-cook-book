Attack
A Distributed Denial of Service attack takes down a website by overwhelming it with traffic. Once a critical point is reached, users will find the site difficult to access. The group is accused of co-ordinating such attacks and demanding money to cease them, thereby allowing normal traffic to flow to the targeted website once more.
The attacks "remain a considerable threat in the European Union and beyond", Europol said.
"This type of extortion attack has become a well-established criminal enterprise and has affected thousands of victims globally, with the number of unreported incidents believed to be much higher. The absence of reporting by private companies and individuals poses particular difficulties in law enforcement's efforts to prosecute these cyber-threats."
It said that the DD4BC group was "exploiting the increasing popularity of pseudonymous payment mechanisms and has been responsible for several Bitcoin extortion campaigns since mid-2014".

Businesses that pay the ransom to the blackmailers risk appearing vulnerable and being targeted again for a higher amount."
Wil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director of operations, said: "These groups employ aggressive measures to silence the victims with the threat of public exposure and reputation damage."

"Fourth-quarter revenue includes a $21m reduction for price protection related charges resulting from the Hero4 Session repricing in December," the firm said in a statement on Wednesday.
In October, GoPro had said there was weaker-than-expected demand for the device because of its initial high price.
The company has also been facing stiff competit
