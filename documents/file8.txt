The price of supermarket petrol has fallen below that of bottled water.
And with the slumping cost of oil, it is expected to plunge under the price of all famous names.
The RAC claimed Thursday that the pattern of price falls suggests a litre of petrol could fall to as low as 86p later this year.
Famous water brands like Perrier, Highland Spring, Evian and Buxton all cost more than this in the supermarket, depending on the bottle size.

The price of crude oil has slumped to around $30 a barrel in recent days, and some analysts say it could go as low as $10.
If that happens, the RAC is predicting that the price at the pumps for both petrol and diesel would come down to around 86p a litre.
That would be the lowest level for almost seven years and down by almost 40per cent on the peak price of 137.3p a litre in March 2012.
With average monthly petrol use at some 107 litres, the cost would be just £92.02, which would be a saving of almost £55 a month compared to four years ago.
Some supermarkets have already cut the price of petrol and diesel to less than £1 per litre.
The RAC said that if a barrel of oil falls to $20, pump prices should come down to around 90p a litre at supermarkets and other cheap fuel forecourts.
It added: ‘A further fall to the $10 mark, as some analysts are now predicting, could pave the way for petrol and diesel to reach as low as 86p a litre.’
A one litre bottle of Buxton Still Natural Water is 90p.
The cost of a single 750ml bottle of Evian Still Natural Mineral Water is 83p, or the equivalent of £1.11 a litre, although the price comes down to 86p a litre for a pack of four.
A 750ml bottle of Highland Spring with a sports cap costs 82p, which is the equivalent of £1.10 a litre. A 750ml bottler of Perrier Sparkling is 96p or £1.30 a litre.
Since the beginning of December, oil has tumbled by 30per cent from $43.26 to a 12-year low of $30.06.
And this week, Standard Chartered became the latest major bank to downgrade its oil price outlook to $10 a barrel. This matched warnings of a slump from the likes of Goldman Sachs, RBS and Morgan Stanley.

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘With no apparent end in sight to the freefalling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016.
‘Breaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come.
‘In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters.’
Mr Williams said some petrol stations are failing to pass on the full value of the fall in wholesale prices, particularly on diesel.
‘We should really be seeing diesel priced several pence cheaper than petrol on every forecourt, to the point where the average price of diesel goes below that of petrol,’ he said.
‘In many areas of the UK the price of fuel is sadly far higher than it should be. We would urge every fuel retailer to price fuel on their forecourts so that it more fairly reflects wholesale prices.’
The RAC said there is a limit to how low petrol and diesel prices can go as tax – fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on the total price, including fuel duty – make up the lion’s share of the cost of fuel.
Mr Williams said: ‘Even if the fuel was given away and the retailers didn’t take a margin, the price of a litre would still be 70p.
‘Every motorist should know that the tax-take at £1 a litre is 75per cent, and at 86p a litre it rises to a staggering 84per cent.
‘Strangely, this means that VAT alone would be 14p, which would be more than the cost of the fuel and the retailer’s margin.’
Despite the relatively high level of tax, the RAC said it appears that the Chancellor, George Osborne, will raise the duty even further in the Budget in March. This would be the first increase since January 2011.
Mr Williams called for a re-think, saying: ‘We would urge him not to use lower fuel prices as an opportunity to extract even more tax from the motorist at the pumps
